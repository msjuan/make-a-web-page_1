				     <p>The web is made up of a bunch of computers that communicate with each other.  When you go to a web page your browser sends a HTTP request to a server.  The server sends back the information you requested over the internet.The web browser interprets the page and sisplahys it on the screen. With Google Chrome you can used their developer tool to explore the HTML and CSS of a webpage.  Web pages are made up of rectangular elements.  some of the elemtent are block while some are inline.</p>

				     <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  CSS stands for Cascading Style sheets.  CSS how you style the page. In one of our class examples we were able to use CSS to make text red in a paragraph using selectors.  You can select different HTML tags or classes when selecting parts of the site in CSS.  Divs are block level elements that takes up the entire width of the site.  Classes are there to style elements that you want to be the same.  Id’s are used to uniquely identify an element in an entire page.  div id=”welcome”  in CSS you a pound sign to select the id.  Class are used when elements are similar.  Helps avoid repititon.
					 Always use an alt tag when adding pictures.</p>

				     <p>As stated before all elements are rectangles.  The div tag is a block element.  It will take up the entire width of the page.  One way to put things next  to each other on your web page it to use a flexbox.  HTML box layout The very center is content.  Image or text that appears on the page.  Next layer is the padding.  The padding clears an area around the content.  The border goes around the padding and the content.  Color property of the box.
Last is the margin.  No color, tansparent.
